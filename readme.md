# ROSE: Repository Of Simple Examples
One working example is worth a hundred lines of explanation/documentation/specification.  ROSE is the antithesis of linux man pages.   

# Organization
Examples are organized thematically.  Files will contain either useful source code examples and/or example output on execution.

# Create a new ROSE file:
- find the appropriate template (or make one)
- copy to a descriptive, searchable name in a thematically relevant folder
- add a new entry
